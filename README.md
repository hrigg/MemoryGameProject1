Memory Matching- Plant Edition
This is a Memory Game with a plant theme.

Directions: 
Test Your Memory by clicking the cards two at a time until you have matched all the cards (30 cards, 15 pairs)!
Test your accuracy by getting the lowest number of guesses OR test your speed by getting all 15 pairs in the shortest time.


User Experience: 

1. User starts by pressing START Button
    This will start the timer AND shuffle the images and randomly assign them to cards
        This allows each game to be a different board arragement

2. User then clicks on two squares / cards one at a time to create a pair. Images will show once the card is flipped One of two things will happen: 
    If the cards MATCH:
    This counts as a PAIR and the cards disappear from the board

    If the cards do NOT match: 
    This counts as a GUESS, the cards remain showing for 1.5 seconds and then go back to face down. 

3. User repeats guessing procedure until 15 pairs/ matches are made. 

4. After all 15 matches are found and cleared, the time will STOP and both the TIME and GUESSES will appear as a score.    
    The number of guesses will log at the bottom in a "Top Scores" category



--> Technologies used in game: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
--> Screenshots included of starting screen and final winning screen with score listed.

-->Challenges: The biggest challenges I faced were working with the CSS and JS to create the cards that had both a front and a back and flipped when clicked. I was able to overlay the cards by using position: absolute and creating a class that rotated the cards on the Y axis when they were clicked. It was also important that both cards had backface visibility hidden. 

-->Stretch features I plan to add: changing theme with selection of checkbox or a button and creating two player mode to see who can get the most matches
