User Experience: 

User starts by pressing START Button
    This will start the timer AND shuffle the images and randomly assign them to cards
        This allows each game to be a different board arragement

User then clicks on two squares / cards one at a time.  One of two things will happen: 
    If the cards MATCH:
    This counts as a PAIR and the cards disappear from the board

    If the cards do NOT match: 
    This counts as a GUESS, the cards remain showing for 1.5 seconds and then go back to face down. 

User repeats guessing procedure until 15 pairs/ matches are made. 

After all 15 matches are found and cleared, the time will STOP and both the TIME and GUESSES will appear as a score.
